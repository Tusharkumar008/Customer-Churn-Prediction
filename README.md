# **Customer-Churn-Prediction**
  The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving and to build robust predictive models using algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting.

# **Project Objective**
  1. Predict customers likely to churn based on their usage patterns, demographic, data and service interactions.
  2. Identify key factors contributing to churn.
  3. Develop a model to recommend targeted marketing campaigns to reduce churn.

# **Introduction**
  **Customer churn** refers to the loss of customers who discontinue using a product or service. This phenomenon occurs when customers cancel their subscriptions or stop engaging with a     
  company for various reasons, such as dissatisfaction with the service, better offers from competitors, or simply no longer needing the product.

# ** Raw Data Overview **
The data provided in this repository is in its raw form, meaning it has not yet undergone any cleaning, preprocessing, or transformation steps. This raw data typically comes from various sources and may contain:

Missing Values: Some entries might have missing or incomplete information. For example, certain fields in a row might be empty, which could represent data that was not collected or was improperly recorded.

Outliers: Outliers are values that are significantly higher or lower than most of the other data points. These can be due to errors in data entry or rare events that may need special handling.

Inconsistent Formatting: Some columns might have inconsistent formatting. For instance, date columns could have different date formats, numerical columns could have non-numeric characters, or categorical variables may be labeled inconsistently.

Duplicate Entries: There may be duplicate rows, which are repeated records that can skew analysis if not handled properly.

Noisy Data: Some data points may not be relevant to the analysis and might introduce noise. This could include irrelevant columns, unnecessary text, or unstructured data that needs to be cleaned.

Unstandardized Units: Different rows might use different units for the same metric (e.g., kilometers vs. miles, or different temperature units), which can cause confusion during analysis.
